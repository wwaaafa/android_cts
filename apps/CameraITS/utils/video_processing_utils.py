  Returns a list of extracted key frames.

  Ffmpeg tool is used to extract key frames from the video at path
  os.path.join(log_path, mp4_file_name).
  The extracted key frames will have the name mp4_file_name with "_key_frame"
  suffix to identify the frames for video of each quality.Since there can be
  multiple key frames, each key frame image will be differentiated with it's
  frame index.All the extracted key frames will be available in  jpeg format
  at the same path as the video file.

  Args:
    log_path: path for video file directory
    mp4_file_name: name of the file in mp4 format.
    Ex: VID_20220325_050918_0_CIF_352x288.mp4
