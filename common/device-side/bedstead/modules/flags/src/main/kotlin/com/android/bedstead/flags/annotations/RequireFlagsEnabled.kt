/**
 * Indicates that a specific test or class should be run only if all of the given feature flags are
 * enabled in the device's current state.
 *
 * <p>This annotation works together with [RequiresFlagsDisabled] to define the value that is
 * required of the flag by the test for the test to run. It is an error for either a method or class
 * to require that a particular flag be both enabled and disabled.
 *
 * <p>If the value of a particular flag is required (by either [RequireFlagsEnabled] or
 * [RequiresFlagsDisabled]) by both the class and test method, then the values must be
 * consistent.
 *
 * <p>If the value of a one flag is required by an annotation on the class, and the value of a
 * different flag is required by an annotation of the method, then both requirements apply.
 *
 * This is a replacement for [android.platform.test.annotations.RequiresFlagsEnabled] which can be
 * enforced by default using [DeviceState] rather than requiring a separate rule.
