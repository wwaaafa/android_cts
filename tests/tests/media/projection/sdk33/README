A test package for validating the security changes in Android U. The platform
changes detect when an app is re-using the user's consent, and either:
1. target SDK U+: throw an exception
2. re-show the permission dialog

The test app re-uses the user's consent token through two possible mechanisms:
1. caching the Intent result containing the user's consent token
2. capturing the display more than once from the same MediaProjection instance
